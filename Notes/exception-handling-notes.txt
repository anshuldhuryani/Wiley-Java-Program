There are some errors being raised by compiler or interpreter at compile-time and run-time depending upon the coding approach a developer follows.

There are types of errors:

	- Compile-Time Errors: 
	
	caught by compiler while writting a program. They occur when we do syntactical mistakes, or mis-spell any keywords. They are also considered as:
		- Syntactical Errors
			- Missing Semicolon
			- Mis-spelled Keywords and so on.
		- Sementic Errors (Expressional Errors)
			- When we writting incorrect expressions.
			e.g.
				num3 = num1 + num2; (Correct)
				num1 + num2 = num3; (Incorrect)
				
				num2 += num1; (Correct)
				num2 =+ num1; (Incorrect)
	Note: Programmers needs to handle or resolve the complile-time error by them selves.	

	- Run-TIme Errors:
		These errors gets occurs due to incorrect input or invalid inputs.
		They are occurred at execution time. Thus,
		They are also known as Exception. 
		They can be resolved with the help of exception handling.
		The program gets abnormally terminated due to exceptions.
		
	- Logical Errors:
		These errors gets occur when we don't get an expected output.
		These are the errors raised by developers.
		They are due to inappropriate logics.
		E.g. Expecting 10 as even number but result is odd.
		int num = 10;
		if(num/2 == 0) 
			System.out.println("Number is even.");
		else 
			System.out.println("Number is odd.");

File Handling:

	File Handling helps in storing the data into the file system.
	Java offers a list of classes and methods to work with file system.
	All the classes are available within java.io package.
	
	Working with File Handing is to work with streams.
	Stream is group of data or characters that travels from source to destination and vice versa.
	
	Streams in Java:
		Byte Stream (Input Stream Class, Output Stream Class)
		Character stream (Reader Classes, Write Classes)
