Java Fundamentals:

Java Variables: 

	A variable is a location in memory to hold the data.
	To indicate the memory, each variable should have a unique name(identifier) given.
	
Creating Java Variables:

	data-type variable-name;
	
	int age;		// Declaring a variable (Declaration)
	age = 23;		// Assigning a value  	(Assignment)
	int age = 23;	// Initializing a value (Initialization)

Java Data Types:

--------------------------------------------------------------

User Input: (Scanner Class)

	Scanner class is the part of java.util built-in package.
	This class helps in reading user input from different sources.
	Such as Input Streams, files and Users etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------
	
Java Operators: 

	Operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables.
	They helps in calculation, comparison and evaluation.
	Each operator performs specific operation.
	
Types of Operators:

	1. Arithmetic Operators
		(+, -, *, /, %)
	2. Assignment Operators (Arithmetic Assignment Operators/Compound Operators)
		(=, +=, -=. *=, /=, %=)
	3. Comparison Operators (Relational Operators)
		(==, != >, <, >=, <=)
	4. Logical Operators
		(AND &&, OR ||, NOT !)
	5. Unary Operators
		(++, --)
	6. Ternary Operators (Conditional Opeator)
		condition ? (True-Expression):(False-Expression)
	7. Shift Operators
		Left Shift (<<)
		Signed Right Shift (>>)
		Unsigned Right Shift ()
	8. Bitwise Operators
		Bitwise OR (|)
		Bitwise AND	(&)
		Bitwise XOR	(^)
		Bitwise Complement (~)
	
Cateogories of operations:

	Binary Operations: Minimum two operands and one operator are required. E.g. num1 + num2
	Unary Operations: Minimum one operand and one operation are required. E.g. num1++

Conditional Constructs

	1. Simple If Statement
	2. If..else Statement
	3. if..else if..else Statement
	4. Nested if..else statement
	5. Switch Statement

Non-Conditional Constructs

	1. break Statement
	2. continue Statement

Looping Constructs

	1. for Loop
	2. while Loop
	3. do..while Loop
	4. foreach Loop (Enhanced Loop)
	
Categories of Loop:
	1. Fixed Loop 
	2. Variable Loop
	
	
For Loop Syntax:

	for(initialization;condition;inc/dec) {
		// Loop Body
	}
	
While Loop Syntax:

	initialization;
	while(condition) {
	....
	....
	inc/dec;
	}
	
do..while Loop Syntax:

	initialization;
	do {
	...
	...
	inc/dec;
	} while(condition);
